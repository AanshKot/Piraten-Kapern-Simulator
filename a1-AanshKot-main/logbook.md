<!-- BUSINESS LOGIC OBJECTIVE
You have to develop a program that will simulate games of Piraten Karpen (a board game with dices
and cards). Your user will select how many games to be played and the different strategies the virtual
players will use to play the game. Ultimately, itâ€™ll print the number of wins for each player on the
standard output. -->
